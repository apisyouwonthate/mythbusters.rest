# Mythbusters.REST

With the relatively recent appearance of GraphQL and gRPC on the API scene, a lot of people have started sharing some Interesting Opinions

- [ ] GraphQL is REST 2.0 (Well defined subset, missing HATEOAS and Cacheability)
- [ ] REST means you have huge responses (Sparse Fieldsets)
- [ ] Type Systems (Hi, JSON Schema exists + baton rouge meme)
- [ ] REST means over-fetching (Compound Documents or HTTP/2)
- [ ] REST means URL versioning (Evolution is a thing)
- [ ] There are different levels of REST (not maturity model means HATEOAS or RPC)
- [ ] GraphQL got rid of their RESTish API (nope Graph API is still RESTish)
- [ ] JSON is slow (well some parsers are slow but some are fast)
- [ ] PUT / PATCH confuses developers (ok sure but they're both useful for different things)
- [ ] REST is outdated because HTTP hasnt evolved (Oh boy no, there are a lot of new HTTP specifications and HTTP/2 is wildly different. REST holds up nicely with modern requirements and HTTP/2)
